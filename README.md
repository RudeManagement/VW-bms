# VW-bms
Can based decoding of VW bms data.

Based on the SimpBMS code by Tom_EVNut https://github.com/Tom-evnut/VW-bms but modified by Jamiejones85 https://github.com/jamiejones85/VW-bms to support a custom board design with 4 can bus transcivers, with 2 the native on a Teensy 3.6 and 2 SPI can buses. Also support for a Mitshubish Outlander Changer and a Tesla P100D SPI current shunt (WIP)
Adapted by me to ignore dropped frames (causes module loss) in order to get it working with victron.
For now, no balancing activated.

It also features a LM393 comparitor for Pilot Proxity detection to enable the AC on input.
